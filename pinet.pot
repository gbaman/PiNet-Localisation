If the server has modules compiled for a more recent kernel, they are misaligned and don't work. To fix this, make sure you are running the most recent version of PiNet, also hit the update-sd option and reflash your SD card to see if that fixes it. If not, a patched set of boot files may not be available yet (they have to be prepared by hand).
